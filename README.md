# Bayesian-Dose-Response-Analysis-and-Bayesian-Prevalence-Assessment
Analysis determining the dose-response relationship of a possible toxic product. The study is based on mice subjects and their response ti different doses of Diethylene Glycol Dimethyl Ether, a high-volume industrial chemical with diverse applications. Data is modelled by a logistic regression that takes vague priors over the model parameters. The prevalent assessment models the prevalence of a certain disease among animals in two different types of farms. In the first part the apparent prevalence of the disease in these two types of farms is estimated. In the second part, based on the historical information regarding the sensitivity and the specificity of the disease-test, bayesian prevalence of the disease is estimated.
